Introduction[edit]
Pharos is a Greek word (Φάρος) which means lighthouse. The Pharo logo shows a drawing of a lighthouse inside the final letter O of the name.

History[edit]
Pharo emerged as a fork of Squeak, an open source Smalltalk environment created by the Smalltalk-80 team (Dan Ingalls and Alan Kay). It focuses on modern software engineering and development techniques. Pharo is supported by the Pharo consortium (for companies) and the Pharo association (for users).

Fork in 2008.
Pharo 1.0 was released April 15, 2010.
Pharo 1.1 was released July 26, 2010.
Pharo 1.2 was released March 29, 2011.
Pharo 1.3 was released in August 2011.
Pharo 1.4 was released in April 2012.[3]
Pharo 2.0 was released March 18, 2013.[4]
Pharo 3.0 was released in April 2014.[5]
Pharo 4.0 was released in April 2015.[6]
Use of Pharo[edit]
Companies and Consultants[edit]
Some companies use Pharo for their development projects.[7] In particular, they use:

Seaside for dynamic web development [8]
Zinc for server architectures [9]
Moose[10] to analyse data and software from all programming languages
Graphic libraries for evolved user interfaces
Roassal to visualize data
The Pharo consortium [11] was recently created for companies wishing to support the Pharo project. The Pharo association[12] was recently created for users wishing to support the project.

Performance and Virtual Machine[edit]
Pharo relies on a virtual machine that is written almost entirely in Smalltalk itself. Beginning in 2008, a new virtual machine (Cog) has been developed that has a level of performance close to the fastest Smalltalk virtual machine.[13] In 2014/2015 the community is working on Spur, a new Memory Manager for this Cog VM that should again increase performance and provide better 64-bit VM support.[14]
