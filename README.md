- The intended *â€œsearchQuick" (sQuick)* is an application to enable a user to search a set of books or texts, like an encyclopedia, or some other topical book collection offline.

- The application comes pre-loaded with test file collection in `./sQuick_new/resources/document` folder. You could also add in more files as per your convenience to your current Pharo image.

- The project can be directly loaded via the `Configuration Browser` in `Pharo 4.0`

- `World` > `Tools` > `Configuration Browser` > `sQuick_new(jigyasagrover)`
